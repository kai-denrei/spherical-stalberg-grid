# Two failure modes this repo keeps hitting (see CLAUDE.md):
#   1) split tokens — a partial commit after scripts/bust.sh leaves asset
#      files at different ?v= values, so a client can serve a stale module
#      alongside fresh ones. bust.sh stamps ONE token per run, so a healthy
#      tree has exactly one distinct ?v= value.
#   2) tokened vendor import — a ?v= on a ../vendor/ path makes the browser
#      load a second copy of three.js (the "multiple instances" bug); vendor
#      imports must stay token-free.
#
# Exits non-zero (with a report) on either. Run it by hand before a push, or
# let .githooks/pre-push run it for you (git config core.hooksPath .githooks).

# 3. A MODULE WITH MUTABLE STATE MUST BE IMPORTED ONE WAY.
#
# `?v=` on an import specifier is part of the URL, so `./x.js` and
# `./x.js?v=abc` are two different modules to the browser and it loads BOTH.
# For a pure module that is only wasted bytes, and ~27 of them are split that
# way in this tree already. For a module that holds mutable module-level
# state — anything with an exported `let` — it is a correctness bug, and a
# silent one: the writer sets a value on one instance and the reader sees the
# default on the other. That is exactly how the second tower roster failed
# first time out (roster.js switched a copy of towers.js that nothing else
# was using, and the board came up as the campaign).
#
# bust.sh only UPDATES tokens, never adds them, so an untokened import stays
# untokened forever and nothing else notices.
